# Advanced Email Attack Techniques

#### 3.1 Spear Phishing

Highly targeted phishing tailored to individuals or roles.

**Example:** HR receives a fake CV that actually contains malware.

***

#### 3.2 Impersonation

Pretending to be someone trusted.

**Example:** Attacker emails finance pretending to be the CFO asking for payroll info.

***

#### 3.3 Typosquatting & Homographs

* **Typosquatting:** Registering misspelled domains (e.g., `micorsoft.com`).
* **Homographs:** Using lookalike characters (`ɡoogle.com` with Greek g).

***

#### 3.4 Sender Spoofing

Forging the “From” field to look like a trusted sender.

**Example:** Appears as `paypal@support.com`, but the real sender is `attacker@malicious.ru`.

***

#### 3.5 HTML Styling Tricks

Attackers use HTML/CSS to hide content.

**Example:** Link text shows `bank.com` but the code points to `evil.com`.

***

#### 3.6 Attachments

Dangerous files inside emails.

**Examples:**

* ZIP file with hidden `.exe`.
* Macro-enabled Word document disguised as an invoice.

***

#### 3.7 Hyperlinks

Links that redirect victims to malicious sites.

**Example:** _“Sign in here to reactivate your Netflix account.”_ → fake login page.

***

#### 3.8 URL Shorteners

Attackers hide malicious destinations behind short links.

**Example:** `bit.ly/security-check` → redirects to fake login.

***

#### 3.9 Use of Legitimate Services

Attackers host malicious content on trusted services (Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Docs).

**Example:** A real OneDrive link opens a document with phishing links inside.

***

#### 3.10 Business Email Compromise (BEC)

Sophisticated fraud involving impersonation or compromised accounts to trick employees.

**Example:** Attacker hacks a supplier’s account and sends a “bank details update” request. Company wires money to attacker’s account.
