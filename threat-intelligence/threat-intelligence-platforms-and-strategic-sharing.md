# Threat Intelligence Platforms & Strategic Sharing

Modern defenders rely on **Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIPs)** and **intelligence sharing networks** to collect, normalize, enrich, and distribute threat data. This ensures that intelligence is not siloed but actively supports **SOC operations, incident response, and executive decision-making**.

***

### 1. What Are Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIPs)?

A **TIP** is a centralized system that collects threat data from multiple sources, normalizes it into usable formats, enriches it with context, and enables secure sharing across teams and partners.

Think of a TIP as the **hub for intelligence**: instead of analysts jumping between OSINT feeds, sandboxes, and vendor reports, the TIP **aggregates everything into one place**.

***

### 2. Why Use a TIP?

Different stakeholders benefit in different ways:

* **SOC Teams:**
  * Real-time IOCs automatically correlated with SIEM alerts.
  * _Example:_ SIEM detects traffic to a suspicious IP → TIP cross-checks with AlienVault OTX and flags it as malicious.
* **Threat Intel Teams:**
  * Aggregate raw data, enrich with context, map to MITRE ATT\&CK.
  * _Example:_ Correlating phishing domains with known APT infrastructure.
* **Management & Executives:**
  * High-level dashboards with sector-specific risks and trends.
  * _Example:_ A report showing ransomware risks in the healthcare industry.

### 3. Data Aggregation in TIPs

**Sources:**

* OSINT feeds: _PhishTank, URLHaus, AlienVault OTX._
* Paid feeds: _Recorded Future, Flashpoint._
* Internal telemetry: _SIEM logs, IDS/IPS alerts, EDR outputs._

**Formats:**

* **STIX/TAXII:** Standardized intel sharing.
* **MISP format:** Structured community-driven sharing.
* **JSON, CSV, XML:** Simpler IOC lists.

***

### &#x20;4. Well-Known TIP Products

* **MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform):**
  * Open-source, widely used in public/private partnerships.
* **ThreatConnect:**
  * Enterprise TIP with strong automation & workflow integration.
* **Anomali:**
  * Cloud-based TIP, integrates with SIEMs and EDRs.
* **ThreatQ:**
  * Analyst-focused, designed for collaborative enrichment.

### &#x20;5. Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP)

#### What It Does

* Collects, stores, and correlates Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).
* Shares structured threat information across organizations.
* Enables **community-driven intelligence exchange**.

#### How It Works

1. Feeds or analysts add IOCs (domains, hashes, IPs).
2. MISP enriches them with context (related malware families, campaigns).
3. IOCs are distributed to partners via STIX/TAXII or MISP synchronization.
4. SOC tools ingest IOCs to improve detection/prevention.

**Example:**

* MISP ingests phishing URLs.
* URLs are automatically pushed to email gateways and web proxies.
* Employees are protected before exposure.

***

### &#x20;6. Strategic Threat Intelligence

Strategic TI = **high-level, long-term intelligence** aimed at executives and planners.

* Focuses on **trends, risks, and geopolitics**.
* Helps guide **budgets, investments, and partnerships**.

**Example:**\
“Healthcare organizations are increasingly targeted by ransomware-as-a-service operators like BlackCat/ALPHV.”

***

### &#x20;7. Intelligence Sharing and Partnerships

Cyber defense improves with **collective intelligence sharing**.

* **ISACs (Information Sharing and Analysis Centers):** Sector-specific hubs for secure intel exchange.
  * **Aviation ISAC:** Airlines, airports, aerospace.
  * **FS-ISAC:** Financial services.
  * **Energy ISAC:** Power grids, utilities.

&#x20;ISACs ensure intelligence **flows securely between trusted members**, creating stronger sector-wide defenses.

***

### &#x20;8. IOC/TTP Gathering & Distribution Workflow

**Walkthrough Example:**

1. SOC analyst extracts malicious IPs from phishing logs.
2. Analyst uploads them into MISP.
3. TIP shares them in STIX format with ISAC partners.
4. Partners import into SIEM/IDS for automated blocking.
5. Correlation across multiple orgs confirms an active campaign.

***

### &#x20;9. OSINT vs Paid Sources

#### OSINT (Free Sources)

* _Examples:_ Spamhaus, URLHaus, AlienVault OTX, Cisco Talos Intelligence (free).
* **Pros:** Free, community-driven, excellent for enrichment.
* **Cons:** Noisy, not always validated, may lack depth.

#### Paid Threat Intelligence

* _Examples:_ FireEye/Mandiant, Recorded Future, CrowdStrike, Flashpoint, Intel471.
* **Pros:** Curated, high-confidence, industry-specific insights.
* **Cons:** Expensive, requires TI team expertise to interpret.

&#x20;**Best practice:** Start with **OSINT + community feeds**. Add **paid intelligence** if your threat profile and budget justify it.
