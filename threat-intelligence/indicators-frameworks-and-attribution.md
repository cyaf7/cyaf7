# Indicators, Frameworks, and Attribution

Modern cybersecurity relies on **indicators**, **frameworks**, and **threat attribution** to detect, analyze, and respond to attacks. Each element provides defenders with a different layer of insight:

* **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):** The forensic “clues.”
* **Frameworks (MITRE ATT\&CK, Kill Chain):** The models for understanding attacks.
* **Attribution:** The process of connecting activity to specific actors.

***

### &#x20;1. Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

#### What They Are

IOCs are **pieces of digital evidence** that suggest a system or network has been compromised. They are the breadcrumbs that analysts follow during investigations.

#### Examples of IOCs

* **File Hashes:** SHA-256 of a malware file (`7d3c9f2...`).
* **IP Addresses:** Attacker Command & Control server (`203.0.113.50`).
* **Domains/URLs:** `login-microsoft-security[.]com`.
* **Email Artifacts:** Phishing “From” addresses, malicious attachments.
* **Registry Keys:** Persistence (`HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Run`).
* **Process Names:** Suspicious execution (`powershell.exe -EncodedCommand`).

#### IOC Formats

* **Simple formats:** CSV, JSON, XML.
* **Open standards:**
  * **STIX** (_Structured Threat Information eXpression_): Standard way to represent indicators (JSON/XML).
  * **TAXII** (_Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information_): Protocol to transport/share STIX data between systems and organizations.

**Example STIX snippet:**

```json
{
  "type": "indicator",
  "pattern": "[domain-name:value = 'phishing-site.com']",
  "labels": ["malicious-activity"]
}
```

&#x20;**Why it matters:** IOCs allow organizations to **detect, block, and share** signs of malicious activity across tools and industries.

### 2. MITRE ATT\&CK Framework

#### What It Is

* **ATT\&CK = Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge.**
* A **living knowledge base** of attacker behavior, mapped into tactics (goals) and techniques (methods).
* Covers both:
  * **PRE-ATT\&CK:** Reconnaissance, weaponization.
  * **Enterprise ATT\&CK:** Execution, persistence, exfiltration, etc.

#### ATT\&CK for Threat Intelligence

* Maps **specific attacker behaviors** to techniques (e.g., phishing → T1566.001).
* Provides defenders with:
  * Detection methods.
  * Mitigation strategies.
  * Known threat groups using the technique.

**Use case:** An adversary uses phishing emails → ATT\&CK entry T1566.001 → defender checks known mitigations and hunting queries.

### &#x20;3. ATT\&CK vs. Kill Chain

#### Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain (2011)

* **Stages of an attack:**
  1. Reconnaissance
  2. Weaponization
  3. Delivery
  4. Exploitation
  5. Installation
  6. Command & Control
  7. Actions on Objectives
* **Strengths:** Easy to understand, good for **high-level IR playbooks**.
* **Weaknesses:** Too **linear** — modern attacks are multi-vector and non-sequential.

#### MITRE ATT\&CK vs. Kill Chain

* **Kill Chain:** Strategic, linear model → best for conceptual understanding.
* **ATT\&CK:** Granular, flexible → best for tactical detection and defense.

&#x20;Most organizations use **both**: Kill Chain for planning, ATT\&CK for hands-on defense.

***

### &#x20;4. Is the Kill Chain Outdated?

* **Partially outdated.**
* Still useful for education and planning.
* But modern attacks are **non-linear** (e.g., simultaneous phishing + supply-chain compromise).
* **ATT\&CK offers more realistic coverage** of today’s TTPs.

***

### 5. Attribution and Its Limitations

#### What It Is

Attribution = linking an intrusion to a specific **actor, group, or nation-state**.

#### Methods of Attribution

* **Machine Attribution:** Automated, based on IOCs, infrastructure, TTPs.
  * Example: Malware hash matches APT28 toolkit.
* **Human Attribution:** Analyst-driven, using OSINT, language clues, targeting patterns.
* **Political Attribution:** Governments declare who is responsible (strategic or diplomatic decisions).

#### Limitations

* **Shared tools:** Multiple groups may use the same malware.
* **False flags:** Attackers deliberately mimic others.
* **Infrastructure overlap:** Shared VPS, compromised servers.
* **Political bias:** Reports can be influenced by state agendas.

Best practice: Treat attribution as **probabilistic, not absolute.** Use terms like _“high confidence”_ or _“moderate confidence”_ instead of certainty.
