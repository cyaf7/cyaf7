# basic Linux knowledge

Here I'll share some documentation I've been learning throughout my Linux course journey.

**Root** is the user who has **full access and permission** to do anything on the system, whoever gets root privileges **controls everything**.&#x20;

**Root** as **/** -> The very first directory in linux, is also referred to as root directory.

**Filesystem** -> It is a system used by an OS (operating system) to manage files. The system controls how data is saved and retrieved. (I'll give examples later)
