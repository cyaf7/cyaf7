# File permissions

UNIX is a multi-user system. Each file/directory can be private, or shared, depending on permissions.

**Types of permissions:**

* r → read
* w → write
* x → execute (run)

**Levels:**

* u = user (you)
* g = group (people in your group)
* o = others (everyone else)
* a = all

**See permissions:**

{% hint style="info" %}
ls -l
{% endhint %}
